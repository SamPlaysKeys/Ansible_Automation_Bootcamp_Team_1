# Initial OS Baseline Baremetal Setup
## Core Objective
Develop strategy for automating the initial OS baseline
setup of baremetal servers and integrate it into the
customers ITSM platform
### Customer Assumptions
- Customer recycles the baremetal server
hardware every 3 years automatically
- Customer receives the hardware with no notice
and has a warehouse full of them waiting to be
swapped
- All the information about the hardware swap is in
an ITSM ticket (name, purpose, IP, iDrac IP,
configuration, etc)
- Customer expects to use the same gold image,
just implement different app requirements
